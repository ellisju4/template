		<Formal Research Paper>
			<h1>Writing in the Engineering World</h1>
			<p>After interviewing my uncle, Patrick Haggood, who works in IT with Arduino software, explained to me what it is like to work as an engineer in the professional work place and what the expectations are of your writing skills. “Writing as an engineer when actually in the work environment is quite different then as a student. It is true that both are important, however one carries more weight than the other. Grades in college are very important, but in the work place you could potentially cost a company thousands if not millions of dollars, if you’re your report is not at its very best. When you get a job as an engineer, you are expected to know how to write technically. I also go with ‘the more boring it sounds, the more likely it’s concise.’ I go by that logic because if my technical paper sounds really descriptive or is very vague, it is obviously not a well-written technical paper. Research is also very important when working as an engineer. You are always expected to know what you are talking about at an expert level. No stone should be left unturned when it comes to your research. As an engineer you should always be punctual. Reports should never be turned in late. The second an objective is given research should begin. The first day of research is the always the most important due to the fact that the first day of research will lead the way for how the project will go.” Patrick Haggood has been in the IT industry since he graduated from the University of Michigan 24 years ago. He explained to me, “technology is constantly changing and evolving. The technology used today is far beyond the technology I used when I was in college. As technology becomes more advance and complex, so do the standards of writing for engineers. So understand that engineering is a profession that will become more challenging.” IT and engineering is a very serious subject to my uncle. He has dedicated 24 years of his life to computer science, he has the experience, and he knows what it takes to write like an engineer. </p>
