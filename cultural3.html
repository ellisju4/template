			<h1>Analysis of Artifact</h1>
			<p>Video games have been around since 1947; the first video game was a missile simulator for World War II (Goldsmith). Over time, video games have grown much in popularity. Since the early 1980s, video games have become a big deal in the political world. Hundreds of psychological studies have been conducted to address the issue of how video games affect society. Since the late 1990s, video games have grown both more popular and more controversial. Because perpetrators of tragic events came from a background of playing video games, video games became the scapegoat for such horrendous tragedies as mass shootings (Benedetti). In reality, video games are not all violent, and they do not all rot the brain. Strategy-based video games actually improve the brainâ€™s cognitive flexibility (Chan).  Video games have gained popularity and, at the rate technology is advancing, this trend will probably continue.</p>
