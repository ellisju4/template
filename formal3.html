		<Formal Research Paper>
			<h1>Writing in the Engineering World</h1>
			<p>After meeting with Professor Foster, who teaches EGR 160 at Michigan State University, I could now conclude that every engineering Professors preaches the same message, that “technical writing is dry and boring, but very important.” Professor Foster explained that “technical writing is extremely important, writing reports, and presentations must be performed in the most clear and concise way. Information must come across in a flawless manner. Important decisions from CEOs, can result in a false product, cost a company millions, and even put people lives in danger. Lab reports and the research done by engineers are critical in any company decision.” He also explained how the technical paper you are trying to create depends on the goal. “. If the report is strictly to inform, you should get straight to the point; CEOs do not have time to read through an entire report. It is possible they are too busy to read the entire report or they may just trust you as an employee and simply skim the report. If you are trying to persuade a company or business to take your product or idea, using number is very important. You should let your numbers do the talking when portraying the benefits your product or idea can give. Numbers speak to people and let them actually see how your product or idea can help them. Another important part to understand about technical writing is that as engineer you must be exact. You should never estimate or assume anything. Engineers carry a lot of responsibilities and estimations can lead to tragic events occurring.”</p>
			<p>Professor Foster also explained technical writing in the school setting. “ As a student, technical writing skills will come with time. The basics when writing for an engineering professor should be that you are getting your main idea across, understanding if your goal is to persuade or provide information, making the professor think the way you want them to think, and making sure you reiterate the important points.” Professor Foster also touched on the subject of researching as an engineering student. “Research is always important and should always be done thoroughly. Your professors are engineers that have been through all the classes you have done and they already know all the tricks. Engineering professor will be impressed with your research if you are able to portray it well. By using, as I said earlier, your numbers to your advantage. As engineers, your professors will understand the point that you are trying to explain through your number. This will not only show them that you are able to write like an engineer, but it will also make your paper stronger and more concise, which is closer to a technical paper written by a true engineer.” </p>
			<p>Professor Foster showed me that technical writing could go beyond just words. “Sometimes technical writing use pictures to convey what you are trying to say. Engineers commonly use graphs, charts, data, and tables in technical papers. By using number and images to help the reader understand what you are trying to say, you not only keep their interest, but you also make it easier for them to take the information in a way that is less complicated for the reader. Charts and graphs are great to use, but should never be over used. An overuse of charts and graphs can make your paper aesthetically displeasing and can overwhelm the reader at times, so use them sparingly.” </p>

			<p> Professor Foster concluded the interview with this. “Everything on this planet that is not naturally created is made by engineers. We lead the way of the future and shape the world, so understand as engineering’s students everything you do should be done at your best.”</p>
