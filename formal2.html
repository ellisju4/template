			<h1>Writing in the Engineering World</h1>
			<p>On the very first lecture day of EGR 100, the class as a whole is told more than once that writing in the engineering work place is the most important part of the engineering profession. Professors Timothy Hinds at Michigan State University does a great job of explaining how the writing in the engineering profession will be boring and dry, but it is the main part in getting the point you are trying to make across. The reports should be simple enough for the person you are working for to understand and know exactly what you are trying to say. Time after time he reiterates, “your engineering reports should not filled with fluff” (Hinds). Papers in the engineering profession are nothing like novels or stories. Everything is clear-cut and should get straight to the point. Professor Hinds does an outstanding job at forcing this crucial part of writing as an engineer into the minds of every student in his class. </p>
