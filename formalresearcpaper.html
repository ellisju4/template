		<Formal Research Paper>
			<h1>Computer Science</h1>
			<p>Writing has evolved from just a too communicate, it has advanced it has become its on entity in many professions. Whether it is writing a paper for a business report, patients status in the hospital, or your very own novel; it is all still writing but expressed and done in many different ways that it could be considered its own form of writing. As an engineer writing is very important to my profession. Engineers try to create a world that makes the lives of everyday people easier, but in this process of making everyoneâ€™s lives easier, risk is thrown into the equation. The difference between a well-written blue print and paper and a terrible one can result in the end of many innocent peoples lives.</p>
