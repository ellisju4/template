		<Formal Research Paper>
			<h1>Writing in the Engineering World</h1>
			<p>Professor Foster’s interview was inspiring and truly makes an engineering student think about what an engineering professor would want to see in your technical paper. As a freshman coming from a normal English writing class into an engineering class is a big transition. It is hard to gauge what the expectations are of your engineering professor since you only have experience with regular English teachers. The change is radical in some cases. An engineering professor has high expectations for your paper as well. This professor has dedicated his life to this profession and is an expert on the topics of what he assigns to you. A study was conducted that touched on both factors stated above. The study focuses on how engineering professor, that do and do not have expertise about the paper given to them, “evaluate papers, compared to writing professors.  The study was as followed, “researchers examined the extent to which a teacher's level of expertise in the subject of a technical paper affects the teacher's reading and evaluation of it. Four engineering teachers and four writing instructors were asked to read the same three student papers and to say aloud their thoughts as they read. The engineering teachers read papers on familiar and unfamiliar subjects. This method allowed direct comparison of the responses of (a) engineering teachers with relevant expertise in a paper's subject, (b) engineering teachers without such expertise, and (c) writing teachers. The comparison indicated that technical expertise helps teachers evaluate validity and engage with the text but has a more ambiguous effect on evaluations of rhetorical appropriateness. The article also examines the teachers' differing attitudes toward the importance of having technical expertise when evaluating and recommends approaches for teacher-training programs (in engineering and composition) based on the results" (Cranford page 1).  This study shows that the expectations are high when it comes to writing for an engineering professor, not only because engineering papers carry a lot of weight, but because the professor will know the points you are trying to get a across and become really involved with paper you are trying to present to him/her.  Know that as an engineer you should always know the message you are trying to convey, because the professor already understand what is being present. They just want to make sure you know what you are talking about and that you sound similar to a professional engineer.</p>
