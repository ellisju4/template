		<Formal Research Paper>
			<h1>Writing in the Engineering World</h1>
			<p>Writing has evolved from just a way to communicate; it has advanced it has become its own entity in many professions. Whether writing a paper for a business report, patients status in the hospital, or your very own novel, it is all still writing, but expressed and carried out in many different ways that it could be considered its own form of writing. As an engineer, writing is very important to my profession. Engineers try to create a world that makes the people’s lives easier, but in this process simplifying life for the average Joe; risk is thrown into the equation. The difference between a well written blue print or paper and a terrible one can result in the end of many innocent people’s lives.</p>
<p>A famous example of this would be the Tacoma’s Narrow Bridge incident, which is a tragedy know by most engineers. This is possibly one of the greatest failures in engineering history. The Tacoma Narrow Bridge was located in Tacoma Washington and was said to be “one of the most beautiful bridges you could lay your eyes on.” The Tacoma Narrow Bridge was opened on July 1st 1940 and collapse on November 1st 1940. The short lived bridge only lasted for five months, but would forever be a reminder to future engineers why writing and accuracy are so important..  Even though the causalities were not high, this is still a huge slap in the face to engineers. The fall of this bridge was said to have many reasons: not enough funding, engineers were not doing their jobs, etc. However, two months after the bridge had collapsed and the smoke had cleared an engineer came forward with what really happened. He said, “due to the lack of time and funding the final report that was sent in, did not one hundred percent approve of the bridge” (Copeland). The bridge was speculated to work but not at the maximum standards that the engineers wanted. For fear of what the higher ups would do, the engineers made the report appear to say that the bridge would work fine. The people funding the bridge who were not engineers simply saw the OK and constructed the bridge.
