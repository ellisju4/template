			<h1>Writing in the Engineering World</h1>
			<p>Engineering is known for being a difficult major due to classes that involve math, chemistry, physics, etc. The writing side of engineering is rarely thought of when it comes to classes and the amount of difficult.  The rumors that students are told are always about the more technical classes that must be taken in college. Technical writing is difficult, but it is something every single engineer will have to do to actually get a job. Every engineering professor I have spoken to has said the same thing, “engineers create the world of tomorrow.” Engineers are told to always be professional and to put their best effort into whatever project they are working on. Students see the technical side of engineering, but they need to step back and see the writing behind engineering and the power it carries. Nothing should ever be taken lightly in the engineering profession, especially when it comes to writing.</p>
