			<h1>Anticipated Effects</h1>
			<p>The effects of my solution would hopefully result in better parenting and for the adults that believe video games cause these mass murders to understand that preventing these events actually starts with them. Parents will hopefully sit down with their children and actually try to understand the problems their kids are facing. A lot of mental issues make children feel helpless when they also suffer from the neglect of their parents. So my solution should help parents understand that they have to power to help their child if they struggle and to make sure they have a better life so that they do not turn into the so-called “monsters” of cable news fame. </p>
