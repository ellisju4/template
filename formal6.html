		<Formal Research Paper>
			<h1>Writing in the Engineering World</h1>
			<p>In the article “Engineering Good Writing”, the writer, Carol Fey, explains how ‘in high school you are never really taught how to write in a technical way. You are simply handed literature to write about and persuade the reader in descriptive ways. This form of writing is nothing like technical writing. After high school, students are thrown into the college of engineering having never been taught how to write as an engineer” (Fey page 2). This difficult adjusting can cause stress and anxiety in student who are trying to adapt to this new form of writing. All hope is not lost, and no student should ever think it is hopeless. Professors and tutor centers are available to help and should always be used. Technical writing is difficult, but it can be taught.</p>
			<p>The article “Engineering Good Writing” gives some tips to help students who are struggling with this subject. “One way of increasing you ability to write as engineer and better your technical writing skills, is by getting on the job experience that throws you into a situation that has you writing in a technical manner. Internships at car companies would be a great place to get this experience to better your writing skills. The job not only gives you experience, but it also creates motivation and pressure in you to become a better writer” (Fey page 3).  Another tip is “if you take a writing class or receive writing help, you should go in with a positive attitude. Many students take writing classes and go in with the same attitude ‘I’m bad at writing’. This attitude only breeds more negative and creates obstacles. Students also believe it is just them struggling, when that is not true at all. A lot of students struggle with technical writing and it is very common, so never feel alone.” (Fey page 3). The last tip is about the basics, “the basics are very crucial and the reason for that is because a lot of people know the basics of writing, such as grammar, sentence structure, and spelling. These skills gauge your ability as a writer in other people’s eyes. If you do not know the basics your paper or report may be marked down or worse, ignored (Fey page 4).” These few tips are a crash course in how to prepare your mindset for when you arrive to the college of your choice as an engineer.</p>
