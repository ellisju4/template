			<h1>Executive Summary</h1>
			<p>It is a common belief of many parents that video games lead to more aggressive tendencies in their children; this is actually a misconception. Many recent mass murders have occurred in the past few years, and people look for something to blame for such tragic events. The public’s target for these atrocities is, wouldn’t you guess it, video games. The public believes that there is a correlation between violent video games and violent tendencies.  There are many reasons why this is simply untrue: many statistics and reports have disproved common misconceptions of video games and violence, violent video games can actually reduce the aggression and violent tendencies in youth, and many mass shooters actually have psychological issues.  My solution to the problem that many parents have with violent video games is simply do not buy them for your kids and do not let them play the violent video games at their friends house. As a parent you should have control and authority over your child.</p>
