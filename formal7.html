			<h1>Writing in the Engineering World</h1>
			<p> Technical writing should always be taken seriously because of the high risk and the importance it carries. Written reports by engineers can be used in honest and dishonest ways. Companies will use these dishonest ways to get around paying for problem they caused. In 2010 during the British Petroleum oil spill, the government tallied that 4.9 million barrels of oil were leaked into the gulf during the oil spill leak. However, a British hired engineer claimed the about 3.3 million barrels were leaked into the gulf. The British engineer was able to modify these numbers by subtracting the amount that BP was “assumed” to be able to collect and barrel. The government factored this into account and reduced the original they came up with to 4.1 million. BP was persistent and had their engineers figured that 2.46 million barrels leaked into the gulf. (Helman 1). These numbers are very important due to the fact that the amount of barrels equals how much BP has to fork over for the damage they caused. The cost were projected to be $17.6 billion dollars, but BP was able to talk it down due to the help of the damage report written by engineers. A difference of billions of dollars can be changed by a report written by an engineer. When a student enters the field of engineers, they should feel a sense of power with knowing what they could do if they graduate from the college of engineering.</p>
