		<h1>Video Games and Computer Science</h1>
		<p>	As a male I am inclined to like video games, but that would be putting it lightly. I love video games. The way that video games could put you in this amazing world and make you feel so involved with characters that are not even real amazes me beyond belief. It may sound nerdy, but I can truly say video games have strongly characterized who I am today and what even made me want to be a Computer Science Major. </p>
		<p>	I remember the first time I played Halo 2 with my much older cousins. I was only 10 and they were in their 20s. To them the game seemed like another everyday thing, but not for me, I was lost in this magical new world. The maps were beautiful and every new room I entered felt like a new adventure. I recall just staring at the sun peaking over the mountains in the game and it awestruck me. My cousin quickly killed my character and I was snapped back into reality. “What are you doing Julian, it’s like you’re not even trying to win.” My cousin said after he killed my character.  I did not care that I just died, I just wanted to get back to that spot and look at the sun over the mountain and feel that warm feeling again. It was near impossible because every time I went over there a sniper shot would pierce the skull of my character. My cousins began to quickly pick up on where I was trying to go each life.</p> 
		<p>	I eventually gave up and snuck on the video game system when they left to eat. The excitement in my body began to swell up as the loading screen began to play the games music. I did not know which map to start with. Snowbound, Isolation, Forge World, they all sounded so good. Snowbound seemed like a good place to start. The map loaded and the exploration began. The snow fluttered everywhere and blew into my characters face. The cold ice mountains would occasionally crumble and break apart. My body got a slight chill, I am not sure if it was from the realism of the snow in the video game or from amazement. I never wanted to leave this world but there were so many more to delve into. As I began to hop from my map to map each one had a different emotion attached to it. Some were bright and happy with a sense of hope, while another was dark and mysterious which left a feeling of disparity.</p>
		<p>	I was only halfway through the list of maps before my cousins came back and kicked me of the Xbox. I felt unsatisfied. I had not even completed the list of maps of this one game. It then hit me. This was just one game. There were thousands of games to explore, different universe to travel to, monsters to slay, and songs to hear.</p>
		<p>	After coming to this discovery it was decided that I must have my own Xbox.</p>
		<p>	“Please please please please. Dad I have to have an Xbox or I’ll just die.”</p>
		<p>	“Maybe Santa will bring one for Christmas just be patient.”</p>
		<p>	And I was patient. Christmas could not have taken any longer, but when I saw that big square wrapped in Christmas paper with my name on it under the tree, I knew exactly what it was. The smaller rectangle boxes must have been the video games I so dearly desired. The excitement swelled inside me and as soon as Christmas came the wrapping paper was demolished. I lifted the Xbox in the sky and ran down the stairs to the TV in record time and began to hook up the cords. I could not contain my excitement. Which of the many universes would I explore first, I thought as the Xbox began to boot up. “Should I save the planet from aliens in Halo, or maybe I should explore the under water cities in Bioshock, oh oh oh or I could create my own band in Guitar Hero.” These thoughts raced through my mind and almost overwhelmed me.</p>
		<p>	I first started off playing Mass Effect. I was playing as the strong well-respected leader Commander Shepard. I remembered creating bonds with the fellow members of my crew and as the game progressed I almost began to care about their safety as if they were real people. I’d spend money on increasing safety precautions just to make sure no harm would befall them. The saddest moment was when my first-mate Lieutenant Kaiden betrayed me and I had to put him down. He was right hand man as with me from the beginning. A tear was almost shed because of the strong bonds that were created. This video game was able to touch me emotionally through death; it was almost literature that I was a character in.</p>
		<p>	The next game was F.3.A.R. A horror game seemed perfect to begin after something so sad. The fear the game produced was real.  My arms would shake, my heart would pound, and my legs would spring up when something jumped out. This was true terror. The fear was beyond real, almost too real. That game had to be put down for a while. Stopping was not a choice, every game had to be explored in full. All day was a gamer’s paradise; my eyes were glued to the screen. On that day video games became a major part of my life. It is what shaped me into the gamer I am today. It may sound nerdy, but I cannot deny the fun I have had from video games, the laughs, the fears, and even the sadness. I realized that I am a gamer not because I don’t have a life but because I choose to have many.</p>
		<p>	Many people have questioned why I decided to be a computer science major if I love videos. I always hear “how come you did not become a computer graphics designer?” The honest answer is I cannot draw for my life. This has not stopped me though; computer science may even be a better choice than computer graphics to get involved in the video game world. Computer graphics may create the characters and these immense worlds, but the computer science aspects of this world truly make it possible for these worlds to come to life.</p>
		<p>	Computer science branches beyond just internal hardware of the computers. It also comes down to software. Software in the video game world is updated every few years, but when it is updated you noticed the differences. The colors pop, it has a cleaner look, and everything runs smoother. With an update in software you begin to go more realistic looks to the games and emotions become more involved with the ability to do much more than what the previous software was capable of.</p>
		<p>	The software used for video games are also able to branch out. The software being used could be for modifying the graphics, giving the sound more realistic features, make gameplay feel more like real life, the list goes on. The ability of majoring in computer science for a job in the video game development world is limitless. Every aspect of video games I could possibly be apart of.  It is amazing how my drive to become a Computer Science was determined by that box I received on Christmas day.</p>
