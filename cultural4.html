			<h1>Description of Issue</h1>
			<p>First off, from 1995 to 2008, sales of video games nearly quadrupled in the United States, but the juvenile arrest rate and murder rate had a steep decline. The drop for juvenile arrest within this time span was 71.9% and the drop for juvenile murders was 49.3% (Fitzmaurice). If the public believes that there is a correlation between video games and violence, then the public must be able to understand the correlation between the decrease of juvenile crimes and murders. </p>
			<p>Another study tried to discover a possible variable in the correlation between violence in youth and violent video games. In this study, it was determined that the reason violent video games have shown a correlation to violent youth is due to the fact that kids with violent tendencies are more attracted to violent sources of entertainment (Fitzmaurice).  It makes perfect sense that a child who dabbles in violent activities and enjoys them would be more prone to violent video games. It is common for people to be attracted to what arouses them or catches their interest; if violence is what they enjoy, then they will probably love violent video games. This is not saying that if you enjoy violent video games that you are a violent person, just that the violence would be something to catch the attention of a violent person. That being said, the public should not believe one correlation and then completely ignore another.</p>
			<p>There is also a relationship between murders and video game consumption. The United States has the highest amount of murder; however, it has a lower amount of video game consumption than most countries. Violent crimes in the United States have dropped, but the popularity of video games has increased (Kain).  These statistics show that violence and video game consumption do not go hand and hand. The United States may be a more violent place, but the video games in the United States are not causing kids to attack each other -it must be another variable. The statistical approach here helps support that claim that video games do not cause people to be more violent.</p>
			<p>Secondly, many social and health studies have been conducted on the aggression levels of youth and how they are affected by violent video games. Studies have shown that when children use video games as an outlet for their aggression, they are able to let out their emotions in healthier ways by venting in the virtual world rather than the real one. In 2007, a study reported that 45% of boys played videos games because “it helps me get my anger out” and 62% play video games because “it helps me relax” (Fitzmaurice).  Video games may show violent images and violent acts, but they allow anger to be let out in a way that makes it so no one is actually harmed or put in real danger. Most parents would probably agree that violence in a fake world is much better than violence in the real world. No matter how realistic a video game is, it is not real, and people need to understand this.</p>
			<p>Violent video games are known for letting you do crazy and horrible things in the virtual world, but not with out consequences.  A health study by Baylor College showed that violent video games provide a healthy way for children to experience rules and consequences for violent actions in a virtual world (Fitzmaurice). The video game world also helps youth experiment with issues such as war, violence, and death without real world consequences. Kids will eventually have to deal with these issues and violence in their life; they might as well receive a lesson in what terrible actions can lead to in a world that will not harm them while letting them see the error of their ways.</p>
			<p>The amount of control given in video games is increasing. With the enhanced graphic and real life motion capture, the actions taken in these video games can sometimes seem real. The level of control granted to video game players, especially in terms of pace and directing the actions of their character, allows youth to regulate their emotional state during play. Research by Carnegie Mellon University shows that a perception of being in control reduces emotional and stressful responses to events (Goldstein). This constant practice of control and reduced stress helps youth control their emotions in the real world.</p>
			<p>Lastly, many mass shootings and massacres carried out by young adults are believed by the public to be inspired by violent video games; however, there is another factor that comes into play when such a tragic event occurs. This is the psychological issues of those people who carry out such horrific acts. A famous case is the Columbine shooting. After the destruction that followed Columbine,, video games were one of the alleged accomplices in what happened. News reports and investigators believed video games were the cause of Eric Harris’ and Dylan Kleblod’s disgusting actions. Eric’s mother even believed video games were the cause of turning her sweet child into a cold-blooded killer. </p>
			<p>Three months after the Columbine shooting, the FBI held a summit in Leesburg, Va., that featured world-renowned mental health experts, including Michigan State University psychiatrist Dr. Frank Ochberg,, as well as Supervisory Special Agent Dwayne Fuselier, the FBI's lead Columbine investigator and a clinical psychologist. The group met with many individuals that knew Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold. The were told the same story –that Eric Harris was charming and told you what you wanted to hear, while Dylan Klebold was a very sad kid that kept to himself. After some time, the group came to the conclusion that Eric Harris was a sociopath with homicidal intentions, and he wanted to use the Comlubine shooting as a way to become famous. Dylan was diagnosed with depression and his motives were said to be caused by revenge sought for his being bullied (Cullen 1). The actions carried out by Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold were not initiated by video game violence, they were initiated by their own severe mental problems.</p>
			<p>A video game may show horrific violence, but it does not take an individual’s and hand and force them to steal and kill. People who carry out these murders and homicides are not even marginally sane. Another example is the tragic mass murder in Newtown by Adam Lanza. </p>
			<p>Investigators discovered that Adam played violent video games constantly in his room with the door locked and the blinds closed (Jaslow). The side that blames video games for these mass murders never look at the other information, such as the fact that Adam Lanza lived on top of a stockpile of disparate weaponry and a horrendous keepsakes: several firearms, over 1,600 rounds of bullets, 11 knives, a starter pistol, a bayonet, three samurai swords (Kovalski). Adam had photographs of what appeared to be a corpse covered in blood and wrapped in plastic, as well as a newspaper clipping of a vicious shooting at Northern Illinois University. Adam was bullied in school and diagnosed with Asperger’s and Sensory Integration Disorder. SID is when an individual has heightened sensory perception to point of being overwhelmed. These two mental issues combined can contribute to severe anger and anxiety (Estes). However, despite all these clear indicators that this child was severely mentally ill and attracted to violence, weapons, and death, some of the public points to video games for forcing Adam’s hands.  Youth such as Adam Lanza, Eric Harris, and Dylan Klebold do play these video games, but the correlation that is being seen is that kids with violent intentions are just naturally attracted to violent sources of entertainment.</p>
