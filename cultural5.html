			<h1>Proposed Solution</h1>
			<p>The solution to the issue that parents have with their children playing video games is simple –do not buy the video games for your child. As a parent you have control over your children, but you cannot force your moral views on other people’s children. If you feel your child may sneak behind your back and play these violent video games at his or her friend’s house, warn the other parents that your child is not allowed to play those kinds of video games. Also, if you think that your child may sneak the video games into the house and play them when you are not around, put a violent video game blocker on the gaming console. Parents have much control over their kids; you cannot blame poor parenting on video games when you as the parent have a stronger influence on the kid than the games themselves.</p>
