		<h1>Blog Entry Day One</h1>
		<p>In WRA 110 we watched a video of a man reading a letter he wrote for his gay Uncle Ronnie. It appears that the purpose of this video was touch the viewer emotionally and for them to understand that it gets better. The video achieves it's purpose by telling a really emotional story that is true, this impacts the viewer and makes them feel for Randy Roberts. The structure of this message is in a poetic form. The poetic form gives a good flow to the story and a more artistic feel which pulls on the heart strings more. This video will help me revise my lived literacy essay by giving me the idea to add more emotion and personal experience to my narrative to actually pull the reader into my story so they can somewhat feel what I felt during this time experience in my life.</p>
