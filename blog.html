		<h1>Blog Entry 1</h1>
		<p> In WRA 110 we were told that are creating a blog that we have to update evry day of class or whenever. This is pretty enteresting because it reloves around coding. Due to my major being computer science I am facisnated on the coding side of this class. Everyone in the class is very shy, which is normal for the first few weeks of class. Hopefully eventually everyone will warm up</p>
		<h1>Blog Entry 2</h1>
		<p>In WRA 110 we watched a video of a man reading a letter he wrote for his gay Uncle Ronnie. It appears that the purpose of this video was touch the viewer emotionally and for them to understand that it gets better. The video achieves it's purpose by telling a really emotional story that is true, this impacts the viewer and makes them feel for Randy Roberts. The structure of this message is in a poetic form. The poetic form gives a good flow to the story and a more artistic feel which pulls on the heart strings more. This video will help me revise my lived literacy essay by giving me the idea to add more emotion and personal experience to my narrative to actually pull the reader into my story so they can somewhat feel what I felt during this time experience in my life.</p>
		<h1>Blog entry 3</h1>
		<p>The lived Literacy paper is due soon. This paper has really made me think about why I chose the major I chose. When I think back on it, it was that little kid inside me that me want to persue enegineering. I want to create video games, be a kid, and just enjoy life. Is there anything wrong with that? I just hope I can live a happy life this way. Cross your finers</p>
		<h1>Blog Entry 4</h1>
		<p>In WRA 110 we turned in our lived literacy papers and put them on our github account. I'm finally starting to understand how github works, which is a relief. Now that it makes sense a lot of stress has been lifted so that's good. </p>
		<h1>Blog Entry 5</h1>
		<p>In WRA we watched the movie the social network in class. The movie really inspires you to want to create a big idea. The rough draft is for the Cultural Analysis is due next week so I should probably start on that. I think I am going to write about the violence of video games affect on people in general.</p>
		<h1> Blog Entry 6</h1>
		<p>Today in WRA 110 we finished The Social Network. It still inspires me to do something great and make a name for myself. Also today I just saw my grade for my Lived Literacy Paper. I am a little shocked because I thought I did really well on my roguh draft so I'm a little thrown off by how I did not do so well. </p>
		<h1>Blog Entry 7</h1>
		<p>Today in WRA 110 our Cultural Analysis paper was pushed back, thank god for that. Mine was barely done and needed a lot of work done with it. We were also given our other project to work on which is a little bit stressful. I feel like I am always a little bit behind in this class but I guess I'll just have to keep catching up. </p>
		<h1>Blog Entry 8</h1>
		<p>The Cultural Analyis paper is due in less than a week. This paper was very challenging, way more challening than the Lived literacy paper. This paper asked us to take a piece of popular culture and take into picture how society views our artile of popular culture. Mine was video games and I feel like they have been getting a bad reputation recently. I hope my paper can englighten some people on how important it is to know the facts before you make your judgement.</p>
		<h1>Blog Entry 9</h1>
		<p>The Cultural Analysis paper was turned in today. I actually feel really good about this paper, I put a lot of time and work into this project so I hope I do well. We were also given time to work with our groups for the documentary project. This project seems like it is going to be fun due to the that fact that I love making videos. I mean who does not like making videos in a class project<p>
		<h1>Blog Entry 10</h1>
		<p>In WRA 110 today we found out our Formal Research project was pushed back a week which is good for me. I am a little stressed about it because it's 3000 words long and I have never written a paper anywhere near that long, also writing is not my best subject. Getting the interviews will also be a lot of work but whatever. You gotta do what you gotta do.</p>
		<h1>Blog Entry 11</h1>
		<p> In WRA 110 we were told about the Documentary project, but Mrs. Daniels did not touch on it that much yet. The Formal Research Project is due next week but I already got my interviews so that should be ok. I just need a litle more researc and I should be ok. This class is beginning to take a lot more work. </p>
		<h1>Blog Entry 12</h1>
		<p> In WRA 110 we informed more about the Documentary project and how it is going to work. My laptop was recently stolen so I was able to get an extension on my Formal Research Project, which was really nice. I am a little worried because I have no idea how to put picures on Github. Hopefully I can figure all this out before te paper is due. For the Emeniem ad, they used the colors wisely to make us really feel like Detroit is changing for the better. It also made the motor industry seem like the hero of Detroit. It is a great marketing idea and seems like it could reall make people believe what they are selling. It also made the car look really slick and it the center of attention</p>
		<h1>Blog Entry 13</h1>
		<p> In WRA 110 we were given a free hour to work on our remix project and gather information as a group. This was crucial time, because we really needed to catch up and get all our ideas together. This was much needed work time due to projects beginning to stack up.</p>
		<h1> Blog Entry 14</h1>
		<p>Today in WRA 110 we turned in our Remix project and we were warned about all the project that are about to be due. The final paper is a group project that reflects the whole class. This final paper requries are the students to work together and develope a website that revolves around everything we have done in WRA 110 this semester.  I am not quite sure if everyone knows what they are doing.</p>
		<h1> Blog Entry 15</h1>
		<p>Today is the day of the final. We did not meet in class today. All the projects and papers are due today. I sent in my lived literacy content for the group final a little less than a week ago so I hope the team recieved it and put it to good use. Today is the last day that I will have a blog update so this is Julian Ellis saying bye!</p>
