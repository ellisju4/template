		<p>Re: Remix Project, Gun control</p>
		<p>Dear Mrs. Daniels,</p>
		<p>I would like to inform you on how our group came to create our remix project on gun control.</p>
		<p>Composing in Context: The choice of gun control, as our topic in the project, made me want to actually know what the student’s stances on gun control currently are. This stance made me more interested and involved in the topic, leading to more quality work and more involvement of students. A problem that was encountered from having students in video was how serious some of them took the issue at hand. Many students laughed or struggled being on camera. This students/audience was still a huge part in the project by giving us actual opinions of the everyday student.</p>
		<p>Process: The group agreed upon this topic, because we all felt this was a serious issue that applies to many people’s lives. The most challenging part in the project, I feel was organizing each part of the video in a proper format that would not overwhelm the viewer with too much information. The systematic approach we took was making the facts separate each change in the video so the video could segue to different parts more fluidly.</p>
		<p>Research:  The most beneficial resources were the ones that gave us a list of facts to pick from such as, dosomething.org, jsutfacts.com, etc. The least beneficial sites were ones that provided videos of speeches or people expressing their feeling.  The speeches were emotional, but we needed facts not opinions. </p>
		<p>Collaboration:  The group’s interaction went really well. Everyone each had a different job at times, but everyone was able to do his or her separate part and put it together in the end to benefit the project. Working in a group was fine, no one slacked and the project was done and in orderly fashion.</p>
		<p>Project Management: The planning done by the group was perfect, however my plan to get the interviews was not so well. The interviews could have been gathered earlier so that the interviews could have been placed better for a higher quality video. If given more time, I probably would have tried to increase the involvement or students and staff in the video. I would get students and staff’s opinions, and compare the generations on their different views.</p>
		<p>Documentary Design: The most effective part of our documentary is definitely how the clips used in our documentary can really touch the viewer in an emotional way. When you watch the clips of the Columbine shooting, you really think about how guns impact society and effective everyone. We as a group agreed on the design decision. The group wanted the design to constantly make the viewer think about how they view guns in society.</p>
