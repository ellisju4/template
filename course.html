			<h1>Course Retrospective Project</h1>
			<p>WRA 110 has been a very interesting class that taught me more than I thought it would about coding. This has been enlightening to me due to the fact that I am a Computer Science major. I came into the class thinking this was going to be an average writing class where the students write essays about nothing that matters to the writers themselves personally, the professors simply grades the papers, and is done with it. WRA 110 was different: we wrote papers about subjects that actually mattered to us and peaked our interest. Once we finished that paper, it would typically lead to another paper. This was very refreshing and made me think more as a writer. I was even able to pull from my past experiences and use them to amplify my papers. </p>
			<p>I came into class already knowing what RAIDS were, however I have never really used them in a paper before. For example, in the Lived Literacy experience paper I actually applied invention, delivery, and style. This really enhanced my style of writing and made me think about what I am creating in my paper, how I am going to deliver it to my reader, and the style I want my paper to represent. I truly feel like this made me a better writer. We also had to upload our story to our own personal website which tested my ability to use codeacademy; this was very different.</p>
			<p>Codeacademy is the website that teaches anyone the basics of coding. The lessons were sometimes frustrating, but the website actually taught the lessons in an affective manner. By the end you begin to feel like a hacker from a science fiction movie and it is actually a great feeling.  This website was able to help us create our very own blog for the class. It was nice having a website of my very own that I could post whatever I wanted to onto it. I had control over my very own website. As time went on our websites in the class became more complicated. The more papers we wrote and upload to our websites, the more complex our website had to become.</p>
			<p>The next paper that was uploaded to our website was the cultural analysis paper. The objective of this paper was to make the students think about how society views an artifact of popular culture or how an artifact of popular culture has affected our society. This research paper really made me think about society and how it views video games. For this project I had to research and think about how video games affect the everyday life of an individual or family. Almost everyone knows what a video game is, but most people have a vague concept of video games or simply believe what they are told by their friends and family members. In WRA 110, I was able to voice how I really feel about the subject without having the high school restriction I am accustomed to. This gave me more freedom and the opportunity to inform the reader about what I truly want them to hear. Thanks to the new skill I acquired from code academy, I was able to post my paper online like the lived literacy paper. Surprisingly, this paper was more complicated due to the fact that we had to add multiple pages to this paper. The more and more papers we wrote and uploaded to our website, the more complex our website would become.</p>
			<p>For the next assignment, the Formal Research Project, I had to write a more formal research paper that focused on the style of writing used in the major I am currently perusing in my academic endeavors. My major is computer science so the paper was about how engineers write in the form of technical writing. This assignment was the longest paper I have ever written, and this really tested my ability to extend my paper long enough to accomplish the criteria without making it sound like I am rambling and feeding useless information to the reader. It was very interesting gathering the interviews for this paper. Being able to talk to people who are actually working first hand in the fields that I desire to pursue and genuinely gave me a feel of the real world experience that I have never gotten before during my time of writing in high school. This paper was heavily based on research and interviews. Setting up dates to have a one on one interview with computer science majors was difficult at times. It also became more complicated due to the fact that the coding part of the class became more complex and required us to apply pictures and multiple pages. However, this paper gave me the closest feeling to my major out of all the assignments in WRA110.</p>
			<p>The remix assignment was recently turned in and was personally my favorite. As a group, we created a video on a subject that truly meant something to us. My group picked gun control. We felt that gun control was a subject that affects everyone’s life. The information gathered for this project was not only useful, but it was also interesting to discover the facts about guns. Many facts were shocking and really made me more interested in the subject at hand. The many debates and interviews of gun control had many strong points. In most of the interviews you could feel the sincerity in everyone’s speeches. I personally felt that this assignment was testing our ability to gather information and analyze it. Analyzing this information and turning it into an effective documentary was the main goal. This assignment was an affective way of not only testing our abilities, but it also gave us an opportunity to express ourselves in a different form of communication other than writing.  The remix project also gave the students of WRA110 a chance to see how the other students of Michigan State University felt about the subject we chose. My interest was peaked when we interviewed other students on their feelings of gun control. It was nice to dabble in the minds of our fellow students and staff members. Surprisingly, many students had a strong opinion of the matter. This was shocking because I assumed before hand that college student might show a lack of interest on such an issue. It was really nice to choose the subject we wanted to do and not be locked in by a certain subject given by the teacher. </p>
			<p>The final paper of this class was the Course Retrospective project. This paper is actually the project itself. I feel the purpose of this paper is to make us, the students, reflect on what this class has taught us and how the class has improved our writing skills. Thinking back on the project, every single paper tested a writing or research skill of mine.  As the papers became more complex so did my writing. Overtime, applying RAIDS to my writing became second nature. Comparing my Lived Literacy paper and the Report Memo for the remix project, I notice a difference in the style of writing. This difference in improvement was quite noticeable. My papers began to seem like I was writing with more of a purpose than just simply satisfying a rubric.</p>
			<p>	I can truly say this class has improved my writing skills a lot more than any class I have taken in high school. College writing is a larger leap from high school writing, but in the end you realize that you really learned something new and were able to challenge yourself in new and interesting ways. The coding in the class really made me reflect on my major and if I want to peruse it to the end. WRA110 helped me realize that I truly enjoy coding and would not mind doing it for the rest of my life. The coding was difficult, but it made me work hard and it was very interesting. Over time the coding process became easier and eventually became fun. Being a computer science major; coding is going to become really important and prevalent in my life. This part of the class was a nice appetizer to the coding I will be doing in my many other classes through out my college experience. </p>
			<p>I can conclude with saying that WRA 110 was a great choice as a writing class to take in college. It is unlike any other writing class I have taken before and I am thankful for that. WRA 110 was very interesting at times, but was still a lot of work at others.  The hard work is definitely worth it. You will notice a change in your writing, and this change is a positive one. I have no regrets in taking this class, however, there was one thing I should have done differently in WRA 110: work on my code academy in better time increments, but besides that, it was a great class and I would take it again in a heartbeat.</p>
